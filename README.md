### Hi there üëã

I am a full-stack developer of 14 years that specializes in Blockchain software development. 

Blockchain will be the future. To quote Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter:
> "There is nothing else more important to work on." 


### What will blockchain do for the future? 
It will create entirely new services. People will be able to get generic or custom contracts that facilitate agreements. These agreements will be anything between ownership of digital or physical goods, transferring ownership of digital or physical goods, transferring ownership of businesses, and more.

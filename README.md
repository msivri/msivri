### Hi there üëã

I am a full-stack developer of 14 years.

I enjoy working on fault-tolerant micro-service architecture with serverless function, queue, pub-sub, notification systems, and optimized logging.

I am currently using my expertise to help improve blockchain.

### What will blockchain do for the future? 
It will create entirely new services. People will be able to get generic or custom contracts that facilitate agreements. These agreements will be anything between ownership of digital or physical goods, transferring ownership of digital or physical goods, transferring ownership of businesses, and more.

Blockchain will be an important part of the future. Follow my Commune DAO project to see how an organization can be completely governed on-chain.

Blockchain development is different from normal development and a lot more complicated. You need to be a creative problem-solver. You have to write optimized code and be constantly up-to-date with new patches and updates. Otherwise, very possible your code will cost millions of dollars in damage or will be unusable.

Due to the current limitations of blockchain, you also need experience in various data storage (SQL/NoSQL), scalable architectures (event-based), and hosting platforms (Azure, AWS) to bring together a comprehensive system.

### Hi there üëã

I am a full-stack developer of 14 years that specializes in Blockchain software development. 

Blockchain will be an important part the future. To quote Jack Dorsey, founder of Twitter:
> "There is nothing else more important to work on." 

Blockchain development is different than normal development and a lot more complicated. You need to be a creative problem-solver. You have to write optimized code and be constantly up-to-date with new patches and updates. Otherwise, very possible your code will cost millions of dollars in damage.

### What will blockchain do for the future? 
It will create entirely new services. People will be able to get generic or custom contracts that facilitate agreements. These agreements will be anything between ownership of digital or physical goods, transferring ownership of digital or physical goods, transferring ownership of businesses, and more.
